# Machine-Learning-credit-dataset-
The dataset has the credit defaults as a class to be predicted. I have applied different algorithms on this dataset. The algorithms which has been used are decision tree, random forest(part of bagging), Ada boost(part of boosting), KNN and Naive Bayes. The RMD has EDA as aprimitive data understanding step before different algorithm is used.
